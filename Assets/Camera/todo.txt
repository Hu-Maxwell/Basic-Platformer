X. if player jumps in same spot, camera moves a little. make the target y value always an int, and only changes when on a new platform 
    - bad way of managing camera

- camera speed (acceleration, velocity) 

- camera lookahead

- camera corners

- make sure these functions are modular, can alternate between multiple camera forms and have one camera controller


- ensure these can be easily implemented at any time
    - camera boxed in in certain locations
    - areas where lookahead or camera zoom changes

- camera looks up / down with w and s input (simply increases the lookahead)
