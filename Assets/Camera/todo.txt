X. if player jumps in same spot, camera moves a little. make the target y value always an int, and only changes when on a new platform 
    - bad way of managing camera

X. camera speed (acceleration, velocity)  
    - bad method too, Math.lerp is simpler 
    - has to be used in fixedupdate

X. camera lookahead
    - interpolation based off of vertical velocity (capped) 

X. camera bounds 

X. CameraInput looking up works but the timer doesn't reset 

- add camerainput for looking down

- make sure these functions are modular, can alternate between multiple camera forms and have one camera controller

- ensure these can be easily implemented at any time
    - camera boxed in in certain locations
    - areas where lookahead or camera zoom changes

- camera looks up / down with w and s input (simply increases the lookahead) 

- ledge detection (increases lookahead based off of whether a ledge is nearby)
