X. buffer for normal jump (time)
	- if isJumping and hasDoubleJumped is true , and space pressed
		- sets a timer for .2 seconds
		- in this .2 second time frame, if isGrounded = true, jump

X. buffer for normal jump (distance)
	- if the user has both jumped and doublejumped, and if jump is pressed when the character is X dist from floor, it will jump once isGrounded is true
	- if the user has jumped and is too close to the floor, it will skip a double jump and wait until the floor is touched

	- tested; there are many flaws with this method. 
		- firstly, it doesn't take into account a dash - if the user presses dash then jump very early on in the dash, and is close to the floor, then the user might get a very very delayed jump
		- it isn't really scalable with slower fall speeds. if the user is falling really slow, the jump buffer might feel really delayed
		- and lastly, the functionality of switching a double jump to a normal jump isn't really too useful. not many players will try to double jump last second

X. coyote time for normal jump
	- completed: seems pretty solid and a decent feature

X. wallJump 
	- force in opposite of wall x and +y 
	- disables walk for a bit 

X. add character facing direction script 

X. use direction char is facing instead of current input 

X. organize jump vars in birdJump file 

X. at 3/4th of jump: 
	- disable downward force
	- player gravity decreases by a bit
